AI Given Prompts

I have designed a simple website with an about me page and labs I have done for ITWS. Using only html and CSS what can be done to make it more eye catching since currently it looks boring with just colors and words

I see u have changed the home page, but the other pages still look bleak as it orginally was

I feel like there is too much empty space in the background for my website. Could you generate some intresting shapes like gems, swords, maybe even a fighter jet if possible?

Using Html and CSS, no javascript, I want to make my website in its entirety have more interactable links, I want buttons to replace the boring blue links that still brings the user to the correct page, when the user hovers over the button i want an animation like the button enlarging to happen. make this change to all pages of html

I would like my websites font to be more unique while still professional, if possible make it match the pages content. Only use html and CSS. create new CSS files if needed also remember to update the html pages to use the desiginated CSS file.
