      <h2> Lab Summary </h2>
      <p> This lab instruced us to recreate our resumes as a website page using the html and CSS we leanred.</p>
      <p> Examples of resumes and css styles were given for use as reference.</p>

      <h2> Challenges </h2>
      <p>My current resume is to say the least lackluster.
         I haven't worked any impressive jobs or started really anything during college so there isnt really anything to fill in.
