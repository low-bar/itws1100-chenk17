Aside from rearranging most files everything went pretty smoothly. I only had to look why my href paths did't work when the preview showed it did, the problem was the web server had a different folder path compared to my local. The other think I took some intrest in was CSS animations the only I included was a shift in color for now. For lab3 b I plan on having an AI model help me make a custom shape moving thing.
